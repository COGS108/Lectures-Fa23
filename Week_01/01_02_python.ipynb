If you call it after hitting an exception, it will automatically open an interactive debugging prompt at the point of the exception. The ipdb prompt lets you explore the current state of the stack, explore the available variables, and even run Python commands!\n",

Importing a package gives you a namespace to grab the elements of the package from.  After importing the math package, `math.ceil(x)` will take a floating point number `x` and give you the ceiling of it... the smallest whole number larger than or equal to `x`. There's a ton of other things in the math package, and it will all be accessible to you inside the math namesapce once you import it: `math.isclose()`, `math.floor()`, etc.. \n",
